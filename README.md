# React Moscow Talks

If you'd like to give a talk to our motley crew of React developers / users / lovers / newbies / explorers, we'd love to hear your proposal!

We're trying something different and using GitHub Issues for talk submissions. This way people can ask questions, give feedback and +1 their favourites. If your talk isn't scheduled for the next meetup, leave the issue open and we may invite you to give it in the future (based on theme or time constraints).

After each meetup, we ourselves or the speaker will update issues with slides, links, and other useful information.

## Things to think about

Have a read:

+ through http://www.slideshare.net/LookAtMySlides/codeware
+ https://github.com/MoscowJS/speaker

That all is a very good overview of how to design a good slidedeck for a technical presentation.

### Slides

Some screens could be a bit smaller. Because of this:

+ Use very large fonts and less text per screen so your slide is legible at the back of the room

+ If you have a code examples, we suggest you make them take up the entire screen with as large a font as possible - optimal limit is 13 lines per one slide

+ Minimize usage of code examples as they will be hard to read

+ Minimize bullet points to 5-7 max. as they will be hard to read

+ If you want to demo something, consider using a screen capture movie or gif. Some tools which can help with this:

### Speaking

Sometimes we can use hand-held mike instead ofa lapel or headset, so practice presenting with one hand [holding a mike](http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1523784.1384980457!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_970/hug.jpg).

Think about where you need your laptop positioned for advancing slides based on where you like to stand while speaking (at the front of the room, or off to the side).

We're always looking for new talks, preferably between 15-30 minutes in length, but shorter ones are great too.

### Themes

Would you like to suggest any things which you'd like to know or just to hear about? Do you know some things could be interesting for the community?

Write about it in comments to [this issue](https://github.com/ReactMoscow/issues/2).
